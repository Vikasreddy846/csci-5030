Please email any time with questions or ask on Discord. I will typically respond within a few hours.

### Grading

Grading will be done primarily on committed work. This will include code (including comments), commit messages, and documentation.

> If it is not committed, it is incomplete.

> If it does not provide sufficient comments or documentation, it is incomplete.

> If code does not run, it is incomplete.

**_Any resource_ may be used to complete assignments** unless otherwise specified. Google things. Talk to other people. Discuss approaches in the Discord. Use open source code. However, all work must be property attributed (see **Honesty** section).

#### Assignments

The largest component of this course will be the programming assigments, which will generally be a small part of the semester project.

- Assignments will be due one week from their assignment, at the start of class.
- Late assignments lose 10% after the first week and 10% every week thereafter.
- Incomplete assignments will lose 10%.

##### Exams

Exams will not be typical. Instead, the midterm and final are both _deliverables_. The midterm will be a usable product milestone, while the final will be a live product.

##### Weighting

Grading will be on an uncurved scale of 90% (A), 80% (B), 70% (C), 60% (D), weighted as follows:

|||
|-|-|
|Assignments|60%|
|Midterm Milestone|20%|
|Final Deliverable|20%|

### Topics

### Honesty

Students are expected to be honest in their academic work, as per the [Honesty Policy of the College of Arts & Sciences](http://www.slu.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences-home/undergraduate-education/academic-honesty).

Committed code must follow industry-standard licensing:

- If you are using open-source code, check the [license](https://tldrlegal.com/) associated with it. Generally, attribution and a copy of the license must be included with the code. Some licenses are more restrictive and may not allow you to use it at all.

- For short bits copy/pasted from knowledge bases (like StackOverflow) or blogs, include a link to the resource.
